## About sandboxes,

* They are just awesome and are basically a shared python playground for testing (mostly, [JC](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg) work !)

## About python scripts,

* 01_data_extraction: We extracted and take a quick look to our data. Our target variable will be price and we decided to create a new feature called ‚Äúhouse lifetime‚Äù (based on the subtraction of the current year and either year_renovated -if is not equal to 0- or the year built). Also, we draw general conclusions on how to use the data.
* 02_data_cleaning: We check for duplicates, NaN or empty space. About dates (when the house was sold), we extracted the year and then encoded months with get_dummies, we also saved geographical information in a different dataset (Seattle), created ‚Äúhouse_lifetime‚Äù feature and, lastly, kindly moved our target (price) to the right.
* 03_eda: It felt like the actual data cleaning. We chekced distributions, skewness, outliers and correlations. We considered checking imbalance data, but made no sense in a Linear Regression model.

## Model refining,

* We discussed about making ‚Äúhouse_lifetime‚Äù based on the last year of the dataset, instead of the current year (2023).
* We discussed about making year a continuous variable, (e.g, 2013,02 to represent february) to have a a single feature that represents yearly trends.
