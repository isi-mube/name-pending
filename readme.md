This is Ironhack's **mid-bootcamp project**, developed and (not-yet)completed by the knowledge triumvirate of <a href="https://github.com/Gladysdata">Gladys</a>, <a href="https://github.com/isi-mube">izzy</a> & <a href="https://github.com/jesus-jpeg">JC</a>.

**Ironhack storytelling**: You are working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a **machine learning** model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated

## Objectives:

**Ironhack objectives:**
* Build a model that will **predict the price** of a house based on features provided in the dataset.
* Use **business intelligence** tools to explore the characteristics of the houses.
* To know which factors are responsible for **higher property value - $650K and above**.

**Group objectives:**
* Be able to **organize** and **divide** the work equally accordingly to each other skills.
* **Document** the process and keep everyone updated.
* **Merging** all files and **discussing the changes** together.
* Learn about **AGILE** methodology.
* Work on personal weak-points and try to **learn from each other**.
* Have fun ! :)

## Project development:

**Project deadline:** 06 days (between 23/04/23 and 09/05/23)

**Week 12:**
* **DAY 1** `(25-04-2023)` | Project discussion, **tasks assignments**** and division of the work. 
* **DAY 2** `(27-04-2023)` | Starting with **Trello**, **merging python scripts**, starting to work on **SQL** and **storytelling-brainstorming**.
* **DAY 3** `(28-04-2023)` | Futher improvments to the code and opening discussions, more task assigments, **SQL part done**. **Also**;
  * We discussed about making **“house_lifetime”** based on the last year of the dataset, instead of the current year (2023).
  * We discussed about making year a **continuous variable**, (e.g, 2013,02 to represent february) to have a a single feature that represents yearly trends.

**Week 13:**
* **DAY 4:** `(02-05-2023)` | Presentation of the changes, brainstorming on how to improve the model, tasks division (Tableau, presentation, python fine-tunning)
* **DAY 5:** `(06-05-2023)` | 
* **DAY 6:** `(09-05-2023)` | **Presentation day**
