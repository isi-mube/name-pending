This project is a knowledge triumvirate of [Gladys](https://github.com/Gladysdata), [izzy](https://github.com/isi-mube) & [JC](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg).

**Ironhack storytelling**: You are working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.


## Objectives:

Ironhack objectives:
* Build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset.
* Use business intelligence tools to explore the charachteristics of the houses.
* To know which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

Group objectives:
* Be able to organize and divide the work accordingly to each other skills.
* Document the process and keep everyone updated.
* Merging all files and discussing the changes together.
* Work on personal weak-points and try to learn from each other.
* Have fun ! :)

## Project development:

Project deadline: 06 days (between 23/04/23 and 09/05/23)

Week 12:
* DAY 1: 25-04-2023 | Gladys/izzy/JC meeting: Project discussion, Tasks assignments and division. 
* DAY 2: 27-04-2023 | Gladys/izzy/JC meeting: Starting with Trello, merging python scripts, starting to work on SQL and storytelling brainstorming
* DAY 3: 28-04-2023 | Gladys/izzy/JC meeting: Futher improvments to the code and opening discussions, more task assigments and divison, SQL part done. Also;
  *  We discussed about making “house_lifetime” based on the last year of the dataset, instead of the current year (2023).
  * We discussed about making year a continuous variable, (e.g, 2013,02 to represent february) to have a a single feature that represents yearly trends.

Week 13:
* DAY 1: 02-05-2023 | Gladys/izzy/JC meeting:
* DAY 2: 06-05-2023 | Gladys/izzy/JC meeting: 
* DAY 3: 09-05-2023 | Presentation day
