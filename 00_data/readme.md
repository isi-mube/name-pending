* **Target variable**: Price. We want to have a deeper understanding of which features contribute to the price value. Also, we want to make some further exploration to higher property value ($650K and above) for the final conclusions.
* **Features**: 
    * We will extract year and month, treating month as categorical (we discussed about making it a continous variable with year)
    * `sqft_living`, `sqft_lot`, `sqft_above`, `sqft_living15` and `sqft_lot15` are interesting features to look at. 
    * `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `floors`, `waterfront` and `view` can be treated as categorical
    * `condition` and `grade` should be treatedd as categorical as well (ordinal, in this case).
    * With `yr_built` and `yr_renovated` we will do **feature engineering** to create the house lifetime (based on the subtraction of the current year and either year_renovated -if is not equal to 0- or the year built).
    * `lat`, `long`, `zipcode` are interesting ones, and we will do further exploration in EDA and make a Seattle map.
    * And of cours, what about `id` right? We will do of course log transform and plot it. (just in case --> it's a joke !)
